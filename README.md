## Abstract
### *BACKGROUND*
Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) is used to describe Lyme disease patients who have the infection cleared by antibiotic but then experienced persisting symptoms of pain, fatigue, or cognitive impairment. Currently, little is known about the cause or epidemiology of PTLDS.


### *METHODS*
We conducted a data-driven study with a large nationwide administrative dataset, which consists of more than 98 billion billing and 1.4 billion prescription records between 2008 to 2016, to identify unique aspects of PTLDS that could have diagnostic and etiologic values. We defined PTLDS based on its symptomatology and compared the demographic, longitudinal changes of comorbidity, and antibiotic prescription patterns of Lyme absence of prolonged symptoms (APS) and PTLDS.


### *RESULTS* 
The age and temporal distributions were similar between Lyme APS and PTLDS. PTLDS-to-Lyme APS case ratio was 3.42%. The co-occurrence of 3 out of 19 chronic conditions were significantly higher in PTLDS -- odds ratio and 95% CI for anemia, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthrosis were 1.46 (1.11-1.92), 1.39 (1.15-1.68), and 1.62 (1.23-2.12) respectively. We did not find significant differences between two groups for the number of types of antibiotics prescribed (incident rate = 1.009, p = 0.90) and for the prescription of each of the five antibiotics (fdr adjusted p values 0.72-0.95).


### *CONCLUSION* 
PTLDS cases have more codes corresponding to anemia, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthrosis. Our finding of hyperlipidemia is consistent with a dysregulation of fat metabolism reported by other researchers, and further investigation should be conducted to understand the potential biological relationship between the two.
